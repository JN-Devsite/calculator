# calculator

Thank you for looking at my calculator application.

# Installation

1. Download / clone the files from the repo
2. Open up a terminal and change directory to go into the applications's root folder eg. cd ~/calculator
3. Run the symphony command 'symfony serve'. It will start a server on http://127.0.0.1:8000
4. Go to http://localhost:8000/home into a web browser and hit enter. That will take you to the calculator.
5. If you need to rebuild on Webpack run 'npm run build'
